# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Subscription Tier Logic and Feature Gating
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement logic to gate features based on the user's subscription tier (Free, Starter, Pro, Elite).
# Details:
1. Fetch the user's subscription tier from Supabase.
2. Implement conditional rendering or feature disabling based on the subscription tier.
3. For example, limit the number of clients for the Free plan and unlock progress graphs for the Starter plan.

# Test Strategy:
Test feature gating with different subscription tiers. Verify that the correct features are enabled or disabled based on the user's subscription status.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Fetch User Subscription Tier from Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a function to retrieve the user's current subscription tier from the Supabase database.
### Details:
Use Supabase client library to query the 'users' table and fetch the 'subscription_tier' field for the current user.

## 2. Implement Conditional Rendering Based on Subscription Tier [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement conditional rendering logic to show or hide UI elements based on the user's subscription tier.
### Details:
Use conditional statements (e.g., ternary operators or if/else blocks) to render different UI components based on the subscription tier. For example, display a 'Upgrade to Pro' button for Free tier users.

## 3. Implement Feature Disabling Based on Subscription Tier [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement logic to disable certain features or functionalities based on the user's subscription tier.
### Details:
Disable buttons, form fields, or other interactive elements based on the subscription tier. Provide informative messages to users explaining why a feature is disabled.

## 4. Test Feature Gating with Different Subscription Tiers [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Test the feature gating implementation with different subscription tiers (Free, Starter, Pro, Elite) to ensure that the correct features are enabled or disabled.
### Details:
Create test users with different subscription tiers and verify that the UI and functionality behave as expected. Test both positive and negative scenarios (e.g., a Free tier user should not be able to access Pro features).

## 5. Handle Edge Cases and Error Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement error handling and handle edge cases, such as when the user's subscription tier cannot be retrieved or is invalid.
### Details:
Implement error handling to gracefully handle cases where the subscription tier cannot be retrieved from Supabase. Display appropriate error messages to the user. Handle cases where the subscription tier is invalid or missing.
