# Title: Set up React Native (Expo) project with Supabase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new React Native project using Expo and configure Supabase for backend services including authentication and database.
# Details:
1. Use `expo init` to create a new React Native project.
2. Install Supabase client libraries: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/auth-helpers-react @supabase/auth-helpers-shared next-auth`. 
3. Configure Supabase client with project URL and API key from Supabase dashboard.
