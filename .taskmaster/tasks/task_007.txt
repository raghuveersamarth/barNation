# Title: Implement Client Feature: Upload Videos (Compressed) and Add Notes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable clients to upload form-check videos (compressed before upload) and add workout notes.
# Details:
1. Integrate a video compression library (e.g., `react-native-video-processing`) to compress videos before upload.
2. Implement a video upload component using Supabase Storage or a third-party service like Cloudinary.
3. Add a text input field for clients to add workout notes.
4. Save the compressed video URL and notes to Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test video upload with different video sizes and formats. Verify that the video is compressed before upload and that the compressed video is playable. Confirm that the video URL and notes are saved correctly in the database.
